# InventoryManagementSystem
This is my DMS Project for Software Development 1 - 31774 course.

It is currently in Phase 1, which is a console-based application designed to help users manage products in their inventory effectively.
This system will allow the user to add, remove, update and view products in the system, either manually, or by importing them from a file, with robust error
handling and clear confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletion or addition.

Users will also be able to get a list of all products under their expected quantity, and calculate the total estimated
value of their entire inventory.

## Features

* Add products manually
* Load patrons from a "," (comma) seperated file (.csv) or a text file, (.txt)
* View all products in the system
* Update products
* Update a products quantity directly
* Remove products
* Clear, informative error messages & input validation
* Console-based menu system

## Requirements

* Console or terminal access
* (Optional) A formatted products.csv file:
